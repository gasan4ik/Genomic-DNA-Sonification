### Giving Voice to Genomic DNA Through FTIR Sonification

This repository contains the analysis and sonification pipeline for **SARA – The Sonic Array of Rhythmic Alleles**, a framework that converts **FTIR spectra of genomic DNA** into structured **musical compositions**.

The code implements:

- Reconstruction of **interferograms** from transmittance spectra,
- Feature extraction from interferograms (peaks, distances, widths, intensities),
- **Parameter-mapping sonification** from spectral features to:
  - pitch,
  - dynamics (loudness),
  - duration (rhythm),
  - spatialization (pan),
- Generation of **MIDI files** suitable for analysis and performance,
- Quantitative **MIDI characterization**,
- Optional **harmonic arrangements** (duet and trio) optimized for human listening.

If you use this code in research, teaching, or creative work, please cite the associated SARA manuscript.
